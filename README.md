# Container based solutions

In this repository common container solutions will be documented.

The common red thread will to show that you can literally execute
any container based solution on Windows, Linux and Mac platform
that follows the Open Container Initiative specifications. And a
container solution usually has defined set of version based
dependencies and should always work the same every time you run it.

The interest in this repository will be on Linux containers that
should be possible to execute on any of the mentioned platforms above. 
As long as graphic rendering is not mandatory. 

Graphic rendering in a Linux container requires special graphic
rendering network solution to be able to render graphics from the
Linux container to the Windows platform, resulting into degraded metal
speed performance.
